touchImageJS 1.0.0
==========

A Javascript library based on Html5 Canvas tag, to create an image viewer that captures the touch events and allows the user resize the image by pinching and moving around inside the canvas.

I'm working on the update to admit more than one image in the same canvas, so the user will jump into different images by swiping

tested on Ipad2, Ipad4, Iphone

And it has no licence. It's all yours!
